I want to learn python. Teach me it's core concepts. Split this into small examples that can be consumed on a single page on a phone. I'm building a database of these, so please provide 5 examples. Provide the output in markdown so I can store it in a database and render it later on my website in a way that will preserve the formatting (bold text, coding blocks etc.). Users won't be able to run the code, so provide comments when appropriate. Keep the comments short. Don't add print statements if comments already explain outputs.

Here's an example format:
{
examples: [
{
"name": "Name for example 1",
"example": "Example using markdown for both code and explanation",
},

{
"name": "Name for example 2",
"example": "Example using markdown for both code and explanation",
},
]
}
